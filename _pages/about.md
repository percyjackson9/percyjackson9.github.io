I am a PhD student in the Industrial Engineering department, Arizona State University, from Fall 2018. I have joined the research lab of Dr. Jorge Sefair, working on large scale optimization of network models using combinatorial algorithms. I have done my Bachelors in Production Engineering from Jadavpur University, and graduated in June 2018. During the course of 4 years, I have worked under the guidance of Dr. Shankar Chakraborty, in the field of optimization and decision making. During the Summer of 2017, I worked under Dr. Dipayan Sanyal, Chief Scientist, CSIR-CGCRI, studying and analysing the machinability of Alumina ceramics. My research interests are in Operations Research, with focus on algorithms and optimization.
