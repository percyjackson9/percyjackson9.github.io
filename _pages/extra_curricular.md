Apart from academics, I am passionate about singing and painting. I did my elementary training of Hindustani Classical Music and Rabindra-sangeet, since a very young age, and continued until my high school days. I also got several opportunities to perform live on stage, in front of local audiences, however not all of them could get video recorded. Below are few links of my performances during my undergraduate studies at Jadavpur University!

I also like to play Table Tennis! (Timo Boll is my favourite player). If you happen to be around ASU, and want to play a game or two, definitely let me know!

Some of my pencil sketches are here below!!!!!
